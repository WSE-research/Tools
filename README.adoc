= Tools

Here, is a summary of tools implemented by the http://wse-research.org/[WSE group] to help in your development or research process.
All are located in their own GitHub repositories.

== XML2RDF converter

If you want to translate well-modeled XML data to RDF, then this tool might become very handy.
Here, the Document Type Definition (DTD) file (i.e., the modeling of the XML data) is used to recognize the structures of the XML data and to automatically generate equivalent RDF data.
Hence, straight-forward conversion is possible with little chance of an error.
The initiative provides two tools:

* https://github.com/WSE-research/XML2RDF-converter[**XML2RDF converter web service**]: A web service for integration into automatic processes
* https://github.com/WSE-research/XML2RDF-converter-web-UI[**XML2RDF converter web UI**]: An interactive web application for controlling the conversion process without technical knowledge

== Image To ASCII Converter

ASCII art can be used to spice up your project. 
Integration into a GUI as well as a console application could be useful.
To generate such images, we are providing here an interactive web application for conveniently configuring the generation process and comparing the results.
Our https://github.com/WSE-research/image-to-ascii-art[**Image to ASCII converter**] integrates several existing approaches and provides export options for SVG, PNG, and plain ASCII data.

== RDF data converter and beautifier

One of the strengths of RDF is the built-in feature that it can be represented by different equivalent data formats. 
Hence, one can transform RDF data from one representation to another without losing information. 
Our https://github.com/WSE-research/RDF-data-converter-and-beautifier/[**RDF data converter and beautifier**] enables users to interactively convert RDF data between different formats.
On top, one can format the RDF data, too.

== LingaF

https://github.com/WSE-research/LinguaF[**LinguaF**] provides easy access for researchers and developers to methods of quantitative language analysis, such as readability, complexity, diversity, and other descriptive statistics.
The tool can be integrated as a Python library and is provided as a web service, too.
